// NaN: Not a number: As the name implies, it is used to denote that the value of an object is not a number. There are many ways that you can generate this error, one being invalid math opertaions such as 0/0 or sqrt(-1)

// undefined: It means that the object doesn't have any value, therefore undefined. This occurs when you create a variable and don't assign a value to it.

// null: It means that the object is empty and isn't pointing to any memory address.

// You can create a constant array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// You can change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota";

// You can add an element:
cars.push("Audi");
